# Simple_Linear_Regression-Sales-and-Advertisement-prediction
Predicted the Sales value increase based on Money spent for TV Advertisement using Simple Linear Regression_ML model <br>

1> Loaded the dataset <br>
2> Checked if any null values presented in the dataset and droped unwanted columns <br>
3> Created Scatter plot using Matplotlib library for understanding the __Correlation__ and found out that its a **positive correlation** as the money for advertisement keep on increasing the Sales also gets increased <br>
4> Splitted the data to training and testing sets <br>
5> Created __Simple Linear Regression model__ <br>
6> Find the best fit line and showing using scatterplot(blue) and line(yellow) <br>
7> Comparing the Actual and Predicted value <br>
8> Finding the Coefficent(m) and Intercept(c) and manually checking if the prediction is correct or not using the equation **y=mx+c** <br>
9> Calculating the performance measures like R2 Score, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error <br>
10> Predicting using New Feature(input)

# Conclusion

The models R2 score is approximately 0.829 (82.9%) which is not that good but its a better model!
